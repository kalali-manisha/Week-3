Objective:
To develop an Expense Tracker application in Python that allows users to efficiently manage their expenses. This project will help you reinforce Python programming concepts, including data handling, user input, and implementing essential functionalities.

Key Features:
User Authentication:

Allow users to create accounts and log in securely.
Store user credentials securely.
Expense Management:

Add new expenses with details such as date, category, amount, and description.
Edit existing expenses.
Delete expenses.
Data Storage:

Save expenses data persistently using a suitable storage solution (e.g., JSON, CSV, SQLite database).
Expense Categorization:

Categorize expenses (e.g., Food, Travel, Utilities, etc.).
Provide a way for users to define their own categories.
Summary and Reporting:

Display a summary of expenses by category, date range, etc.
Generate reports (e.g., total expenses for a month, expenses by category).
User Interface:

Command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries such as Tkinter or PyQt.
Data Visualization (optional):

Visualize expenses using graphs or charts (e.g., pie charts, bar charts) using libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly.
Project Structure
Planning and Design:

Define the scope and requirements of the application.
Design the user interface and data model.
Development:

Set up the project environment.
Implement user authentication.
Develop functionalities for adding, editing, and deleting expenses.
Implement data storage.
Develop summary and reporting features.
Create the user interface.
Testing:

Test each feature individually.
Perform integration testing to ensure all parts work together.
Fix bugs and issues.
Documentation:

Write clear and concise documentation for the application.
Include instructions for setup, usage, and contribution.
Implementation Steps
Set Up Project Environment:

Create a virtual environment.
Install necessary packages (e.g., Flask for web app, SQLite for database).
User Authentication:

Implement user registration and login functionalities.
Use libraries like bcrypt for password hashing.
Expense Management:

Define a data model for expenses (using classes or database schema).
Implement functions to add, edit, and delete expenses.
Data Storage:

Choose a storage method (e.g., SQLite database).
Implement functions to save and retrieve data.
Summary and Reporting:

Implement functions to calculate total expenses, filter by category, etc.
Generate textual reports and summaries.
User Interface:

Develop a CLI using Python's built-in libraries (e.g., argparse).
For GUI, use Tkinter or PyQt to create windows, forms, and display data.
Data Visualization (optional):

Use Matplotlib or Plotly to create visual representations of expense data.
